# Features

This mod adds a container where you can register your favorite apparels.

By assigned a colonist as the owner of the container, the colonist can change into all their favorite apparels with one click.
On the contrary, you can take it off with one click.

The recommended way to use it is to register combat apparels in your favorites.
By doing so, you can easily change between normal and combat apparels.
Colonists can usually spend time in work apparels, and when colonists are attacked, colonists can wear combat apparels and intercept them.



# Details

Add the following two containers.

■Fav Locker
You can register any apparels.
When changing into a favorite, colonists change apparels faster than usual.

■Power Armor Station
It is like a power armor station that appeared in fallout 4, and you can only register power armor that can be produced in the final stage.
The time to change apparels is significantly reduced.

# Languages



	- English
	- Japanese(日本語)
	- [strike]Russian(русский) by Tkhakiro[/strike] (Not supported from ver2.00)




# Changes (v2.00 = v2.10)

■Improvement


	-  Compatible with Core ver1.2.



■Bug fix


	- Fixed a bug that the scroll bar of dialog "Register Favorite" has strange behavior.
	- Fixed a bug that the stored apparels are hidden when "cautioned apparels" is hidden in the dialog "Register favorites".




# Known bugs

None.


# Improvement plan



	- Added compatibility patch to other power armor mods
Vanilla Armor Expanded and more...
	- Added "Power Armor Station" function
I'm thinking of repairing or modifying the armor.
